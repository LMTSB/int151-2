*** Functional Programming ***
---
- Functional programming is a declarative programming
- In functional programming we treat functions as a first-class citizen like a data
- Functional programming emphasizes immutability, where data couldn't change
- Higher order function is a functions that take function as an arguments
- Function scope variable inside a function cannot be acces from anywhere outside the function
- Closures is the combination of function bundled together. Since nested function is a closure therefore nested     function can "inherit" the arfuments and variables of its containing function
